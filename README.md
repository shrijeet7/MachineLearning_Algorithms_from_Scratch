# MachineLearning_Algorithms_from_Scratch
This project deals with implementation of various machine learning models from scratch using python, without actually importing them from the sklearn library

Till now the models implemented
1. k-means clustering
2. knn classifier (k-nearest neighbour)
3. Naive Bayesian Classifier

The machine learning algorithms are implemented from scratch and the libraries used are numpy and math

library used:
pandas & mathplotlib : for data handling , manpulation and visualization of datasets
Train Test split (from Sklearn.model_selection) : To split the dataset into training and test sets
various perfrormance measures
sklearn.metrices : To measure accuracy_score , precision, recall , f1_scroe and confusion matrix
